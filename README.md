# CNN_vs_Fully_Connected_Neural_Network
comparison of performance and numbers of trained parameters used for image classification

I did this progect using some assignments for "Deep Learning" specialization on coursera.org.
# Goals:
* to build an algorithm capable of recognizing a sign with high accuracy
* to compare creating image classification using regular neural network and cnn
